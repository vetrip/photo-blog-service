# photo-blog-service

I have started this REST service project on a belief that i would have my own photo hosting web app one day. Even though there are lot
of hosting applications already exist , i wanted this application to be a playground for innovative ideas/creativity on both programming/photography.

I have created this REST webservices project using  below frameworks,
  1) Jax RS 2.X - Jersery REST
  2) Spring 4.x
  3) Hibernate 4.x
  3) MySql Database
  4) Sl4fj 1.7.x /logback 1.1.3
